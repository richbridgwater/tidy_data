Script objectives:
----------------------
 
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


The repo includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.md'

- 'run_analysis.R'

- 'CodeBook.md'


Before running the run_analysis.R script in R, make sure the samsung data is downloaded from
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip and un zipped.

The "UCI HAR Dataset" folder needs to be located in your working directory for the script to work properly.

Note: This R script was created and tested on a MAC computer. It has not been tested on a PC environment - I ran out of time!
